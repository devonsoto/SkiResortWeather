**WeatherSkiResorts.py: **Using WeatherUnderground's API, this script will get the weather information from various resorts and print out their weather conditions. 

- [x] Download and collect Weather Conditions from various ski resorts 
- [x] Print out what conditions I want (temp, wind speed, snow , ..etc)  
The route I want to take is to have each weather condition weigh a certain amount.
Depending on conditons points will be added. At the end the script will print the resorts and their points in ascedning order. 
- [ ] Make weights for each condition
- [ ] Calculate the score for each resort and then print it out.
